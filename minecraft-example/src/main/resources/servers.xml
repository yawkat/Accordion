    Example configuration file that lists all servers in the network.

<hosts>
    <!-- Each host (computer / machine) has one <host> entry. The host= attribute specifies the IP. -->
    <host host="localhost">
        <!--
            Each server on this host / machine is listed with a <server> entry. The type= attribute is the category of
            the server. The id= attribute is the ID of the server in that category (it must only appear once for this
            category in the entire file!). The port= is the port that the network magic should happen on. It is not the
            minecraft port! Make sure to firewall it so only computers on the network can access it as it is unprotected.
